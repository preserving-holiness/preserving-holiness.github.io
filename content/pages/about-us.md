Slug: about-us

We are an independant, non-denominational consortium of Believers in the doctrine of the Second Work of Grace, as delivered to the pen of one, John Wesley (1703-1791). We preserve the message for its modern audience, to keep true Spiritual Freedom alive in our world.

On this site, we have Book Summaries and Chapter Synopses, Sermon Summaries and video summaries, all of which glorify God, Holy Living, and the doctrine of Holiness.

From time to time, we may post specifically labelled articles that do not come from Holiness sources, but which the maintainer of this site nevertheless believes hold some merit in our Walk with God.
