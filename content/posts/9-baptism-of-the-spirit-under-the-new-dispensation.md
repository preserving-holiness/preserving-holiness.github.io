From the moment Christ was glorified, God poured out the Holy Spirit in fuller measure than ever before. This gift—“better things” promised in the prophets—marks the Christian age and calls us to live at a higher level of faith and holiness than Old Testament saints.

1. **Greater Light and Guidance**

   * Under the Old Covenant, believers had only hints of Christ through types and shadows. Today we “behold, with open face, the glory of the Lord.”
   * God’s will once came “line upon line, precept upon precept.” Now it comes alive in Christ’s perfect example, showing us not just what to do, but how.

2. **Transforming Power of Truth**

   * Prophets longed to know what the Spirit meant when He spoke of Christ’s sufferings and coming glory. Now we experience that glory firsthand.
   * The gospel doesn’t merely inform; it converts, sanctifies, consoles, and fills us with joy—things unimaginable under the law alone.

3. **Role of the Holy Spirit**

   * The Spirit takes God’s revealed truth and makes it effective in our hearts, building up the Church and saving souls.
   * We are called to “rise above” Old Testament believers just as the New Covenant rises above the old.

4. **Historic Outpourings**

   * **Apostles at Pentecost:** Before Jesus’ death, the apostles were slow, timid, and self-seeking; afterward they were fearless, unified, and powerful, “turning the world upside down.”
   * **Early Church Martyrs:** For centuries, believers endured torture and death joyfully, drawing crowds by their divine courage and love. Even persecutors became converts.
   * **Medieval Witnesses:** Saints like Thomas à Kempis and Catherine of Siena shone with the same Spirit-anointing—deep devotion, prophetic insight, and holy power.
   * **Reformation and Beyond:** Luther’s breakthrough came when “the just shall live by faith” thundered in his soul. Scottish Covenanters, Wesley and his cohorts, the Tenents, Fletcher, Edwards, and Finney all saw their ministries ignite when Spirit-power sealed their faith.

5. **Marks of Spirit-Baptized Believers**

   * **Heavenly Savor:** There’s an unmistakable, divine fragrance about their lives and words—so compelling that skeptics recognize its source (as when a staunch Catholic admired a godly woman’s holiness).
   * **Inner Peace and Joy:** Their “sun never sets” in hardship; even in prison or amid suffering, they know unshakable peace and delight in God.
   * **Self-Mastery:** No longer slaves to anger or fear, they exhibit calm endurance in trials and control over every passion.
   * **Moral and Evangelistic Power:** Every Spirit-filled Christian wields unique gifts—boldness like “sons of thunder,” comforting words that build up, or a drawing power that leads many to repentance.

**Conclusion**
If we truly desire to serve our generation in Christ’s name, we must “tarry” in prayer until we, too, are “endued with power from on high.” Only then will our lives shine, our words carry conviction, and our hearts enjoy the fullness of “the victory that overcomes the world.”
