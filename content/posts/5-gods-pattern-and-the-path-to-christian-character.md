**Scriptural Foundation**
Jesus promised that all who believe in Him would receive the Holy Spirit, making their lives overflow with spiritual power (John 7:37–39). Paul contrasted righteousness by faith with striving through law (Romans 9:30–32), showing that true growth depends on faith and the Spirit, not our own efforts.

**God’s Divine Pattern**
Scripture outlines a clear model for the Christian character, called the “new man,” replacing our old, unrenewed nature:

- **Cleansed and Redeemed:** Freed from sin and idols, like the prophetic vision of eternal light and unending joy (cf. Isaiah, Joel’s outpouring).
- **Transformed by Glory:** Reflecting God’s image, growing from one level of glory to the next, filled with Christ’s love (2 Corinthians, Ephesians).  
- **Living in Fellowship:** Walking in God’s light, perfecting love, enjoying continual communion with Father and Son.
- **Empowered by the Spirit:** Joyful prayer, rivers of living water, strength in weakness, conquering all trials (Galatians, Romans).  
- **Spiritual Victory:** Growing faith and love, exercising power with God and people, shining as light and salt to the world.

This new life is not our achievement but God’s design—every trait springs from His Spirit.

**The Source of True Transformation**
Every vital trait of the new man—vision of glory, fellowship with God, assurance of hope, love, joy, peace, spiritual victory—comes from the Holy Spirit:  
- He reveals Christ, testifies we are children of God, intercedes in prayer, and produces His fruit in us (Romans, Galatians).  
- He enables us to put off old habits and put on Christlike character by His power (Romans 8, Galatians 5).  
- Rivers of living water refer directly to the Spirit’s outpouring (John 7:39).

**Order of God’s Work in the Believer**
1. **Conviction and Faith:** The Spirit convicts us of sin, brings repentance, and leads us to trust Christ—this begins justification.  
2. **Receiving the Spirit:** After believing, we are invited to ask for and receive the Spirit’s fullness. Apostles prayed that new believers might receive this powerful baptism (Acts 8:14–17; 19:1–6).

**Seeking the Spirit in Faith**
Just as sinners ask for forgiveness, believers must ask God in faith for the Spirit’s fullness: “How much more will your Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him!” (Luke 11:13). Jesus told His disciples to remain in Jerusalem until they were clothed with power from on high (Luke 24:49; Acts 1:4–8).

**Consequences of Neglect**
Without this Spirit-baptism, Christian life falls short:  
- It remains powerless and hesitant, unable to reflect God’s pattern fully.  
- Historical examples: The twelve at Ephesus and Apollos were fervent believers but lacked fullness until they received the Spirit, limiting their impact (Acts 19; 18).

**Two Views Compared**
1. **Instantaneous at Conversion:** All the Spirit’s presence and power arrive at new birth.  
2. **Distinct Promise after Belief:** Conversion brings initial indwelling; full empowerment comes afterward by asking in faith.

**Why This Matters**
Teaching that nothing more is needed after salvation deprives believers of power, joy, and assurance. Misleading instruction sends them chasing shadows instead of seeking God’s promised fullness. Pastors and teachers must guide the flock to the clear word: ask, wait, and receive the promised baptism of the Spirit.

**A Call to Seek**
This chapter aims to help readers know God’s pattern and attain it. If you have believed but never asked for the Spirit’s fullness, discover the better thing God offers. Read on, pray, and receive until filled with all the fullness of God.
