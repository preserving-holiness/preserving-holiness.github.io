Deep within each person lies a private sanctuary—his spirit—where God meant to reside. This "I Am" in us, a gift from the eternal I AM, depends on God's constant sustaining power. While God is self-existent and majestic, man's spirit is a creaturely reflection, able to know himself and, by the Spirit's impression, to know God (1 Cor 2:11).

Scripture teaches that humans are spirits inhabiting bodies, not merely bodies housing spirits. True worship springs from spirit and truth, unbound by rituals (John 4:23–24). Adam's Fall expelled God's presence from our deepest core, leaving a sacred space that only Christ can enter when invited by faith (Rev 3:20).

In new birth, Christ's Spirit returns, imparting God's own nature to believers. Without this divine indwelling, outward rites—baptism, sacraments, church membership—remain hollow or misleading. Therefore, "keep your heart" vigilantly (Prov 4:23), cherishing the Spirit's presence that marks us as God's children (Rom 8:9, 16).
