1. **Claim Your Birthright**  
   - The Spirit-filled life is not optional or for a select few. When Christ died, this fullness became available to every believer.  

2. **Welcome Him as Friend, Not Foe**  
   - The Holy Spirit isn’t strange or scary. He’s Jesus’ presence in you—gentle, loving, and good.  

3. **Surrender Everything**  
   - It’s not just about blessings. Are you ready to let go of your plans, pride, and control? True filling requires handing over every area of life.  

4. **Long for More Than Basics**  
   - Prayers, Bible study, and good deeds are vital—but they’re just the start. Crave deeper fellowship, purity, strength for service, and victory over temptation.

**Steps to Receive the Holy Spirit**

1. **Offer Your Whole Self**  
   Present your body, thoughts, emotions, and will to God as an act of worship (Rom. 12:1–2).  

2. **Ask in Faith**  
   Simple, believing prayer is enough: “Ask, and it will be given you” (Luke 11:9–13).  

3. **Live in Obedience**  
   The Spirit is promised to those who follow Christ’s commands (Acts 5:32).  

4. **Trust His Promise**  
   Just as you received salvation by faith, receive the Spirit’s fullness the same way (Gal. 3:2).
