1. **Divine and Human Forms in Christ**
   - Jesus perfectly combined divine glory and human perfection: He is both our righteous Lord and our exemplar.
   - His spiritual life also depended on the Holy Spirit, just as ours does.

2. **Prophetic Foundation**
   - Isaiah’s prophecies foretold that the Spirit would rest on the Messiah, granting wisdom, understanding, counsel, power, knowledge, and reverent awe (Isaiah 11:1–3; 42:1; 61:1).
   - These passages show Christ needed the Spirit’s anointing to fulfill His mission.

3. **New Testament Confirmation**
   - John 3:34 emphasizes Christ’s speech and works came from the unlimited Spirit given to Him.
   - Christ’s frequent prayer and solitude reflect His dependence on divine power.

4. **Christ’s Baptisms of the Spirit**
   - At His baptism by John, Jesus prayed and received the Holy Spirit as a dove (Luke 3:21).
   - After overcoming temptation, He returned “in the power of the Spirit” and began teaching boldly (Luke 4:14–15).
   - In Nazareth He read Isaiah 61, declared its fulfillment, and amazed the crowd by the Spirit’s power in His words.

5. **Christ as Exemplar for Believers**
   - If even the sinless Son needed Spirit-baptism, we must likewise seek it before doing God’s work.
   - Christ asked the Father for the Spirit, showing us to ask, seek, and wait for “power from on high.”

6. **Christ’s Teaching on the Spirit**
   - **Seek and Receive**: "Ask, seek, knock"—God gives the Holy Spirit to those who earnestly ask (Luke 11:9–13).
   - **Personal Presence**: The Spirit is not mere influence but a permanent, personal Comforter abiding within believers (John 14:16–17).
   - **Greater Blessings**: Believers receive richer gifts and understanding through the Spirit than through Christ’s earthly ministry (John 7:38–39).

7. **Spirit’s Mission**
   - The Spirit teaches, reminds, guides into truth, glorifies Christ, testifies of Jesus, reproves the world, and reveals future things (John 14–16).
   - Through the Spirit we know God and Christ intimately, are transformed into Christ’s likeness, and bear spiritual fruit.

8. **Promises Through the Spirit**
   - **Answered Prayer**: In Jesus’ name we may ask anything and receive it so joy may be full (John 16:23–24).
   - **Divine Indwelling**: Father, Son, and Spirit dwell in us, uniting us with God (John 14:23; 17:21–23).
   - **Peace and Joy**: We share Christ’s peace and joy as the Spirit abides in us (John 14:27; 17:13).
   - **Greater Works**: Believers, empowered by the Spirit, will do even greater works than Jesus did (John 14:12).

9. **Church’s Mission and Unity**
   - All believers, as a Spirit-anointed body, are sent to labor for world salvation.
   - Each receives a special baptism of power for their unique mission, and together exhibits unity, love, and divine power that convinces the world.

10. **Christ’s Final Commission**
   - After rising, Jesus breathed the Spirit on His disciples, commanded them to wait in Jerusalem for Spirit baptism, and then sent them out to preach with power (John 20:22; Acts 1:4–8).
   - Believers must both go in Christ’s name and tarry until they receive the Spirit’s power.

**Key Takeaway:**
Jesus, though divine, modeled for us the need to seek and depend on the Holy Spirit. Through prophetic promise and His own teaching and example, He shows that Spirit-baptism is essential for empowering, guiding, and transforming believers to finish God’s work and bear witness to the world.
