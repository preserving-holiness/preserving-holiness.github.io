In our busy world, the challenge isn’t learning to read but choosing what to read. There’s far more printed matter than any of us can absorb. Emerson once noted that reading nonstop for seventy years would fill only a tiny niche in a huge library. So the real task is deciding which books deserve our time.

The finest books do more than transfer information; they spark curiosity. A great writer guides us through ideas, teaching us to notice wonders on our own. When we recognize thoughts that were already in our minds, the joy of discovery is like witnessing our own ideas come to life.

True learning comes from within. A teacher or book can offer facts, but lasting growth happens when we contribute our own insights. Education should train our minds to see clearly, not just to store facts—like an eye for ideas instead of a warehouse of information.

A thoughtful mind, illuminated by reflection or by spiritual insight, can transform how we read. Our thoughts are shaped by what enters our hearts, so it’s vital to choose reading that uplifts and deepens us.

For Christians, the Bible is the foundation, read with careful reflection. A strong hymnal follows; meditating on classic hymns can teach theology. Finally, a balanced diet of Puritan writings and Christian mysticism nourishes the soul, leading to richer understanding and a more vibrant faith.
