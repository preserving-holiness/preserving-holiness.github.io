**Key Scripture Passages**
- **Acts 19:1–6**: Paul meets believers in Ephesus who haven’t heard of the Holy Ghost. After baptism in Jesus’ name and laying on of hands, they receive the Spirit, speak in tongues, and prophesy.
- **Acts 8:14–17**: Peter and John pray for Samaritan believers to receive the Holy Ghost after baptism.
- **Acts 10:44–47**: The Holy Ghost falls on Gentile listeners in Cornelius’ house; they speak in tongues and praise God.
- **Ephesians 1:13–14; 3:14–21**: After believing, Christians are sealed with the Spirit as a guarantee of their inheritance and are strengthened in their inner being to know Christ’s love and fullness.
- **John 7:38–39**: Believers receive the Spirit after Christ’s glorification, symbolized by rivers of living water.
- **1 Corinthians 12**: The Spirit gives varied gifts—wisdom, healing, prophecy, tongues—to build up the Church.
- **Acts 2 (Pentecost)**: The apostles unite in prayer, experience visible signs (wind, tongues), and are filled with the Spirit, speaking God’s word boldly.
- **John 14–16**: Jesus promises another Helper (Comforter) who will dwell with believers forever, empowering and guiding them.

**Main Lessons**
1. **Occurs After Conversion**: The Holy Ghost is given *after* a person believes, completing their qualification for Christian service.
2. **Empowers Believers**: This baptism equips Christians for tasks beyond natural ability—prayer, witness, endurance.
3. **Visible Change**: Recipients and observers notice a distinct transformation—new boldness, spiritual gifts, praise.
4. **Sought by Faith**: The Spirit is not automatic at conversion but promised to all who genuinely seek and wait in prayer.
5. **Seal and Pledge**: The Spirit acts as God’s seal on believers, assuring them of forgiveness and inheritance until full redemption.
6. **Fellowship and Fullness**: Through the Spirit, Christ and the Father dwell within, leading to deep fellowship, love, unity, joy, and peace.
7. **Diverse Gifts**: Every believer receives spiritual gifts to serve the body of Christ; prophecy (spiritual truth) and tongues edify the Church.
8. **Unity in the Church**: Baptism in the Spirit fosters unity and love, reflecting the oneness Jesus prayed for among his followers.

**Effects of the Baptism**
- **Power**: Strength to pray, witness, and endure hardship ("run and not be weary").
- **Insight**: Deeper understanding of Scripture and God’s truth.
- **Assurance**: Conviction of sonship and eternal life ("we know we are of God").
- **Fellowship**: Intimate communion with the Father, Son, and other believers.
- **Joy and Peace**: Inner serenity, joy in trials, and hope that surpasses understanding.

**Conditions to Receive**
1. **Recognize the Promise**: Understand that this blessing is distinct from conversion, miracles, or other gifts.
2. **Claim by Faith**: Believe firmly in God’s promise and righteousness through Jesus.
3. **Seek Wholeheartedly**: Pray and wait in unity, like the early disciples at Pentecost.
4. **Persevere**: Continue seeking until the Spirit fills the heart.

**Conclusion**
The Baptism of the Holy Ghost is God’s highest gift in the New Covenant. It is essential for full Christian living, empowering believers with spiritual gifts, deep fellowship, and lasting change. Like the early Church, Christians today should understand, seek, and receive this promise to walk in the Spirit’s fullness.
