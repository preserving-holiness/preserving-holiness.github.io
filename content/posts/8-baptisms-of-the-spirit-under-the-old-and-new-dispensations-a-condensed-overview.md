**Introduction:**
Joel’s prophecy (Joel 2:28–29) foretells a universal outpouring of the Spirit; John clarifies that the Holy Spirit’s full gift awaited Christ’s glorification (John 7:39).

**Old Testament Baptisms:**
- **Enoch and Early Saints:** In varying degrees, individuals like Enoch enjoyed communion with God’s Spirit.
- **Abraham and Jacob:** Each experienced transformative encounters (e.g., Abraham’s assured faith in God’s promise; Jacob’s vision at Bethel).
- **Moses:** Exchanged the Spirit’s power for intimate knowledge of God’s character—Moses’ radiant face after Sinai marks a new inward communion.
- **Seventy Elders:** God shared Moses’ Spirit so they could prophesy—true prophecy flows from the Spirit’s illumination, not merely future-telling (Numbers 11).
- **Saul and Others:** Kings, prophets, even unlikely recipients (Saul, Saul’s messengers, Balaam) received temporary Spirit-baptisms that conferred speaking God’s truth and specific gifts.
- **Elisha:** A lasting double portion of Elijah’s Spirit inaugurated his prophetic ministry (2 Kings 2).

**New Testament Precursors:**
- **Zacharias, Elizabeth, Mary:** Each filled with the Holy Spirit before Pentecost, echoing Old Testament patterns but pointing ahead to greater realities (Luke 1).
- These experiences included joy, prophecy, magnifying God, and foreshadowed Pentecost’s power.

**The Great Difference:**
1. **Universality:** Old anointings were rare and for individuals; New promises the Spirit to *all* believers (Joel’s “all flesh,” Acts 2).
2. **Permanency:** Once temporary, now an abiding Comforter who remains with the Church (John 14:16).
3. **Greater Power:** Old saints saw partial glories; Christ’s life and resurrection fully reveal God’s character. The Spirit now unveils Christ’s glory in us, bringing life, sanctification, and joy beyond earlier experiences.

**Scriptural Testimony:**
- **Peter:** Prophets longed to know the Spirit’s timing—Pentecost fulfilled their prophecies (1 Peter 1:10–12).
- **Hebrews:** Old saints received promises by faith but awaited our fuller blessings (Hebrews 11:39–40).
- **John:** The Spirit in its New Testament fullness was not yet given until after Christ’s glorification (John 7:39).

**Implications for Today:**
- Believers now enjoy Spirit-baptisms equal to or surpassing the highest Old Testament experiences.
- The Church’s weakness stems from ignorance or neglect of Spirit-filled living.
- Restoring this doctrine and practice will usher in revival and prepare for the millennium.

**Vision of the Future:**
Ezekiel’s river of life (Ezekiel 47) symbolizes the ever-growing, life-giving power of the Spirit in the Church, promising a golden age yet to come.

**Conclusion:**
The Old and New Testament baptisms share a divine illumination and power, but the New dispensation’s gift of the Spirit—universal, permanent, and supremely powerful in Christ’s light—marks a transformative era for the Church. May every believer experience this all-empowering baptism. Amen.
