**Opening Promise**  
Jesus tells His disciples in Luke 24:49, "I send the promise of my Father upon you," pointing back to Joel's prophecy that God would pour out His Spirit on all people.

**Three Stages of the Promise**  
1. **Promise Phase (John the Baptist to Resurrection)**  
   - Disciples knew Jesus personally—His teachings, death, and resurrection.  
   - Jesus built their hope for a new power beyond what they already experienced.  
   - They expected an "outpouring" of divine energy they had not yet seen.

2. **Preparation Phase (Resurrection to Pentecost)**  
   - After rising, Jesus commanded the disciples to "tarry" in Jerusalem.  
   - Their work paused so they could receive what had been promised.  
   - Though seemingly idle, they grew in unity and expectation, gathering 120 believers in prayer.

3. **Realization Phase (Pentecost)**  
   - The Holy Spirit arrived like a rushing wind and tongues of fire (Acts 2).  
   - Peter describes this as God "shedding forth" the Spirit—an overflow beyond their hopes.  
   - Believers gained new, inner proof of faith: the Spirit's direct witness in their hearts.

**External vs. Internal Evidence**  
- **External Proofs**: Scriptures, John the Baptist’s testimony, God’s miracles, and Christ’s works all point to Jesus but rely on logic and outside signs.  
- **Internal Witness**: Only the Holy Spirit gives an immediate, living assurance—like feeling alive—free from the need for argument.

**Impact of the Holy Spirit**  
- **Transformation**: Converts in distant lands, unfamiliar with Christian logic, believe and change by the Spirit’s power alone.  
- **Emotion and Joy**: Early believers experienced vibrant emotion and spiritual delight, qualities lacking in many modern services.  
- **Authority**: Freed from fear and doubt, they spoke with boldness rooted in life, not mere logic.

**Ongoing Promise Today**  
Some claim the Spirit’s coming was a one-time event only for the first church. But if the fullness received by the apostles doesn’t apply to us, it’s like eating Peter’s meal in A.D. 33 and expecting it to nourish us now—impossible across centuries and seas.

**Questions for Reflection**  
- Is the Father’s promise solely for first-century Christians, or must each believer be filled today?  
- Does "the new birth" and Spirit’s fullness happen once for all, or must we personally receive them?  
- Do we have what the early Church enjoyed, or have our expectations fallen short?

**A Call to Seek**  
Jesus urged His followers to wait because the Spirit’s coming would mean the difference between failure and success. The early Church said, "They were amazed," because God gave more than He promised.  

**Invitation**  
If today’s faith feels weaker than what was promised, admit the gap. Seek Scripture, prayer, obedience, and faith so that the Father’s promise may be yours in full—beyond expectation, just as in the first Pentecost.
