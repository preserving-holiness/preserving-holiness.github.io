Sound doctrine is vital for Christians: right beliefs lead to right living, just as good fruit comes from healthy vines. Doctrine simply means the religious beliefs we hold, and these must match truth precisely. The apostles defended pure teaching, resisting false ideas about Christ and the Trinity in their letters. Each generation must guard its doctrine against driftâ€”our hearts invite error like weeds in an untended garden.

In every field, accuracy matters; yet religious thought often tolerates haziness. Without the Bible as final authority, reason or sentiment fill the gap, resulting in foggy beliefs no one fully trusts. This liberal vagueness is spreading into evangelical circles, diluting convictions and weakening moral power.

We need a gentle, firm dogmatism: cultivating clear, confident belief in Scripture to root out error and bear enduring spiritual fruit.
