Every person’s true character shows in their free choices, not in what they do under compulsion. When the apostles were freed from prison, they chose to join their praying companions rather than scatter—revealing their priorities and faith. Likewise, a man forced to stay home by illness is different from one who skips church for golf: the latter’s voluntary choice tells us more about his heart.

In societies, freedom multiplies voluntary actions. But more choices bring more risks: if a nation values pleasure over liberty, it may squander the freedom won by past generations. In religion, casual use of Christian liberty can weaken faith: choosing weekend leisure over spiritual fellowship gradually dulls devotion.

Our choices don’t just reflect who we are; they shape who we become. We gravitate toward the company that matches our thoughts and values. To gauge our spiritual health, ask: when free, where do I go and what do I think about? Facing these answers honestly helps us stay true to our deepest commitments.
