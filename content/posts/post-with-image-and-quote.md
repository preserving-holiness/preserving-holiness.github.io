Summary: A test post to demonstrate including images and blockquotes.

This post demonstrates how to include images and blockquotes in your articles.

## Including an Image

To include an image, you first place the image file in the `content/images` directory. Then, you can embed it in your post using standard Markdown syntax. The path should be relative to the `content` folder.

![An example image]({static}/images/sample-image.jpg)

The `{static}` tag tells Pelican to look for the file in your static content location.

## Including a Blockquote

Blockquotes are a great way to call out important text or quotations from other sources. You create them by starting a line with a `>` character.
