Today it’s easy to imagine a Jesus who is gentle, dreamy, or merely a wise teacher—but the New Testament presents something greater. From the start, the apostles proclaimed that Jesus of Nazareth, crucified by men, was raised from the dead and made both Lord and Christ (Acts 2:36). He is fully God and fully man: divine in nature, human in body, a single Person—not two beings.

Crucially, Jesus’ humanity did not vanish at His glorification. Now seated at God’s right hand, He remains a real Man who intercedes for us. He is the eternal High Priest, visible and audible, with our same human features, yet exalted above all creation. Through Him we approach God, receive life, and gain hope. He holds the keys of death, advocates for believers, and secures our salvation.

We must reject any substitute Christ—whether poetic fiction or self-help ideal—that refuses His lordship. Salvation comes not from a vague decision or a feeling, but from trusting the whole, living, victorious Jesus—God’s chosen Man—who bore our sins, died, rose, and triumphed. Any lesser Jesus cannot save. He is the only way (John 14:6), the hope of Israel, and the fulfillment of every human longing.
