Will Rogers once quipped that abolishing peace conferences would end wars. Today, endless headlines proclaim “Talks to Begin,” driven by the belief that conversation alone can resolve every dispute. But constant negotiating often distracts us from real dangers—Pearl Harbor reminds us that talking doesn’t always prevent harm.

This misplaced faith in tolerance and goodwill sees criminals and killers as merely misunderstood souls in need of a friendly chat. Yet true justice demands more than understanding; it requires confronting wrongdoing and upholding moral standards.

Even the Church has fallen prey to bland ecumenism, valuing agreement over conviction. Preachers, eager to stay popular, avoid pointing out errors in other beliefs and forsake the courage to defend truth. But biblical heroes never compromised core principles: Moses refused to debate the golden calf, and Jesus never bargained with the Pharisees.

Peacemaking within God’s family is a heavenly gift. Yet when unity comes at the cost of truth and righteousness, it betrays Christ. Light and darkness cannot merge. Christians must speak truth boldly, not simply seek to be liked. Some things—truth, justice, righteousness—are not negotiable.
