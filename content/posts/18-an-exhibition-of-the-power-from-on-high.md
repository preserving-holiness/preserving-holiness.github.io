In this chapter, Charles Finney recounts his early experience preaching in a remote part of Jefferson County, New York, after being invited by a Female Missionary Society. Arriving in Antwerp in early May, he found no active church life—the meetinghouse was closed and the townspeople were steeped in profanity, which distressed him deeply.

**Preparatory Agony and Divine Encouragement**  
Fearful of hostile reactions, Finney was encouraged by the Lord through Acts 18:9–10 (“Be not afraid… for I have much people in this city”). Overwhelmed with compassion, he spent Saturday in fervent prayer, wrestling with tears in a nearby grove. Each return to the grove brought relief only when it was time for the Sunday service.

**First Sermon and Revival’s Spark**  
On Sunday morning, Finney preached from John 3:16, contrasting God’s love with humanity’s contempt. Directly addressing known profaners in the audience—pointing out those he had overheard cursing—his honest rebuke melted the hearts of listeners rather than alienating them. The church caretaker, moved by the morning meeting, reopened the brick meetinghouse for an afternoon service, which was likewise filled and powerfully impacted. A revival ignited in Antwerp and spread rapidly throughout the countryside.

**Journey to “Sodom” and a Second Outpouring**  
Two weeks later, asked to preach in a hostile neighborhood mockingly called “Sodom,” Finney walked there on a sweltering Monday, nearly faint and discouraged. Upon arrival, the discordant singing tormented him until he fell to his knees in desperate prayer. God answered with a vivid text: “Up, get you out of this place… for the Lord will destroy this city.” He expounded on the destruction of Sodom, Abraham’s intercession, and Lot’s lonely faith, which initially angered the congregation.

As he pressed the message home, God’s presence struck the assembly suddenly and overwhelmingly: men, women, and children collapsed under conviction, crying out for mercy. Finney knelt beside individuals, whispering the gospel until they grasped Christ, then lifted their own prayers for others. The meeting lasted until sunset, after which Finney left the old man known as “Lot” to continue.

**Lingering Impact**  
The following day, many remained under deep conviction in a private home. Finney preached again, and all found relief and hope. Years later he learned that his converts in “Sodom” remained committed believers, and one young man, converted at that first meeting, went on to pastoral leadership. This outpouring, Finney concludes, produced permanent fruit throughout that region.
