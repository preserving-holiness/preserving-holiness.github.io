**Chapter 1: Who Is the Holy Spirit? (Abridged)**

**1. Defining “Spirit”**  
When we speak of spirit here, we aren’t talking about courage, temperament, or energy. Spirit is real—another mode of being, just as real as matter. While matter has weight, shape, and occupies space, spirit can penetrate everything—bodies, thoughts, even other spirit.

**2. What Is the Holy Spirit?**  
The Holy Spirit is a divine Being existing in this same nonmaterial mode. No weight, size, or color—but no less real. He is not mere enthusiasm, genius, or inspiration. He is a Person: with will, intelligence, feeling, and the power to love, hear, and speak.

**3. Biblical and Historical Witness**  
- **Creeds:** The Nicene Creed (AD 325) calls Him “Lord and Giver of life” to be worshiped with Father and Son. The Athanasian Creed repeats: “Such as the Father is, such is the Holy Ghost,” implying equality with the other Persons of the Trinity.
- **Hymns:** Writers pray to the Holy Ghost with divine titles: “power divine,” “cleanse this guilty heart,” “reign supreme.” Such prayers can only be addressed to God.
- **Scripture:**  
  - **Omnipresence:** “Whither shall I go from Your Spirit?” (Psalm 139:7) – only God is everywhere.  
  - **Eternity:** Hebrews 9:14 speaks of the “eternal Spirit,” a quality no created being has.  
  - **Baptismal Formula:** Matthew 28:19 instructs baptism “in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit,” placing the Spirit on equal footing with God.

**4. Why It Matters**  
Many Christians accept the doctrine of the Spirit without knowing or experiencing His power. Truths can lie dormant if we don’t teach and apply them. Just as belief in healing does little unless practiced, belief in the Spirit’s fullness does little unless we seek it.

**5. What the Spirit Is Like**  
Everywhere, always present—He is indistinguishable in character from the Father and the Son. If Jesus walked among us today, we’d feel welcome, loved, safe. That is the Spirit: the same love, kindness, and warmth we find in Christ.

**Invitation**  
Believe not just in doctrine but in living reality. Invite the Holy Spirit to fill your heart, transforming you from within with divine presence, power, and peace.
