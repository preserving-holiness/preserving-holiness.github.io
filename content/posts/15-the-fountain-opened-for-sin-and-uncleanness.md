#### 1. Ancient Fountains as a Spiritual Picture
In ancient Palestine, cities dug deep rock reservoirs and sealed them to store water against droughts or sieges. When opened, these fountains gave life—cool drinking water and a means to cleanse. If the reservoir cracked and ran dry, it was called a “broken cistern” and was a source of despair.

In Scripture, God and Christ are often compared to these fountains:
- **Fountain sealed:** A special source of joy guarded for someone beloved.
- **Fountain opened:** A time of deliverance when water (life) flows freely.
- **Broken cistern:** False hopes that disappoint.
- **Fountain of living water:** God’s continual supply of spiritual life.

#### 2. Salvation in Christ: Objective and Subjective
**Objective:** Christ’s redemption is perfect and complete, offering everything our souls need. It stands ready whether people accept it or not.

**Subjective:** It becomes real when the soul desperately seeks freedom from sin, recognizes Christ’s sacrifice, and trusts in His cleansing power—like city-dwellers urgently praying to open their sealed reservoir.

- **Closed fountain (to the unbelieving soul):** Christ’s grace is ignored when hearts cling to worldly pleasures, pride, or self-righteousness.
- **Opened fountain (to the believer):** When the Holy Spirit opens hearts, Christ becomes “the power and wisdom of God” for redemption, offering peace and strength.

#### 3. A Higher Blessing: Baptism of the Holy Spirit
Beyond initial salvation, believers can experience a deeper blessing when filled with the Holy Spirit (the Pentecost event). Before this:
- Faith is cautious and dim.
- Assurance is weak; obedience is by effort.
- Joy and peace come in small measures.

After the Spirit’s outpouring:
- Truth shines clearly; doubts vanish.
- Strength flows naturally; obedience becomes joyful.
- Inner thirst for God is fully quenched--"living water springs up into everlasting life."

#### 4. Prophetic Promise: "In That Day"
Zechariah’s prophecy speaks of a future time when every believer will experience this Spirit-filled life:
- God will purify His people completely—no sin found (Jer. 31:33–34; Ezek. 36:25).
- The Spirit will be poured out on all believers, young and old (Joel 2:28–29).
- The Church will shine so brightly that nations will come to its light (Isa. 60:1–3).
- This marks the beginning of lasting glory and the millennium.

#### 5. Conditions for the Fountain to Flow
**For Individuals:**
1. Deep hunger and thirst for holiness.
2. Prayerful seeking of divine fullness.
3. Open faith that Christ alone meets every need.
4. A personal encounter where the Spirit reveals Christ’s fullness.

Once one believer is filled, their testimony stirs others to seek the same. Their transformed lives become rivers of life reaching many.

**For Churches:**
1. Hold and preach the truth of full redemption.
2. Live out its cleansing power in members’ lives.
3. Manifest the Spirit’s transforming work visibly.

A church meeting these conditions shines as a beacon; around it, people find Christ and cleansing as from an opened fountain.

#### 6. The Role of Methodism
Methodism’s creed centers on full and free redemption in Christ. Its glory lies in:
- Upholding this gospel truth.
- Demonstrating its life-changing power in believers.

If Methodism remains true, it will lead many into the Spirit’s fullness. If it falls into dead orthodoxy, it will lose its mission and shame itself.

*This abridgment preserves the core imagery and teaching: Christ as a sealed fountain opened to cleanse and empower believers, culminating in a universal outpouring of the Spirit that fulfills prophecy and marks the Church’s greatest glory.*
