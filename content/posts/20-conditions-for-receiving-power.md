Jesus promised his followers a special power: “Tarry in Jerusalem until you are clothed with power from on high” (Luke 24:49). This chapter explains how we can receive that power today.

**1. Be Converted, Then Consecrated**
- **Conversion** means turning to Christ, leaving behind pride, selfishness, and doubt. It is a personal commitment for salvation.
- **Consecration** is a deeper step: dedicating your life and abilities to Christ’s work—sharing the gospel and serving others. The first disciples were converted but waited to be consecrated before acting on their mission.

**2. Accept the Commission**
- Jesus gave a clear mission: make disciples of all nations (Matthew 28:19–20). He then told them to wait for the promised power.
- True commitment means embracing this task as your life’s purpose. Every believer, not just pastors, is called to share Christ’s love in words and actions—through prayer, writing, work, or caring for others.

**3. Wait in Prayer and Faith**
- The disciples gathered in Jerusalem, prayed together, and asked God for strength each day. They did not simply pray once and go on with their business. They persisted until the Holy Spirit came at Pentecost (Acts 2).
- Genuine waiting involves active prayer, faith in Christ’s promise, and willingness to depend on God until he answers.

**4. Four Key Needs**
Believers often miss out on this power because of four common obstacles:
  1. **Unaware of the Commission:** Many Christians think only ministers share the gospel. Yet every follower of Christ is commissioned to be a witness.
  2. **Doubtful of Power:** Some believe the Spirit’s special power is for a few gifted people. But Jesus promised it to all who believe.
  3. **Weak Faith:** Without strong faith, we cannot claim Christ’s promise with confidence.
  4. **Lack of Persistence:** We pray briefly and give up. Lasting prayer, like the disciples’, brings spiritual enduement.

**5. Assessing Church Weakness**
- Today, many ministries report minimal fruit. For example, mission boards often see only a few conversions per year per worker. This suggests a lack of sustained prayer and power-filled witness.
- Both church leaders and members share responsibility for this weakness. When the Church stays weak, ministry stays weak—and vice versa.

**6. Steps to Receive Power**
1. **Review Your Salvation:** Ensure your personal faith in Christ is settled. Only then can you focus on others’ needs.
2. **Embrace Your Calling:** Decide to spend your life in God’s service, however you are gifted.
3. **Pray Earnestly:** Gather with other believers, pray regularly, and hold fast to God’s promise.
4. **Wait in Faith:** Do not stop praying until you sense the Spirit’s empowering presence.
5. **Step Out Boldly:** When you receive power, act on God’s call—preach, serve, and live as Christ’s witness.

**Conclusion**  
The promise of power is for every Christian. Like the first disciples, we must be converted, consecrated, and persistent in prayer. Then, God will clothe us with the Spirit’s power to fulfill our mission and bring many to Christ.
