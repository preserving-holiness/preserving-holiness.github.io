<p>Formal schooling isn’t the only path to learning. Even without teachers or classrooms, you can educate yourself by using your mind well. Three key activities—thinking, observing, and reading—form the foundation of self-education.</p>
<p>First, cogitation. True learning begins when we let ideas play and grow in our minds. By comparing, weighing, and refining thoughts—much like an architect building a design—we stretch our intellectual limits. Few engage in deep thinking, but it yields the richest rewards.</p>
<p>Next, observation. Our senses deliver facts we then shape into knowledge. A child naturally learns by observing the world; adults, however, often lose curiosity and settle into routines. Cultivating careful observation ensures our ideas stay grounded in reality and prevents our minds from filling with stale assumptions.</p>
<p>Lastly, reading connects us to others’ experiences. Good books expand our view and offer insights we might never glimpse firsthand. But reading alone isn’t enough: knowledge must be digested through thought, blended with fresh observations to become truly ours.</p>
<p>By practicing these three activities—thinking deeply, observing keenly, and reading widely—you can build a robust, lifelong education on your own. No formal degree is needed; only curiosity, discipline, and the desire to understand.</p>                </article>
