<ol>
<li><strong>Divine and Human Forms in Christ</strong></li>
<li>Jesus perfectly combined divine glory and human perfection: He is both our righteous Lord and our exemplar.</li>
<li>
<p>His spiritual life also depended on the Holy Spirit, just as ours does.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Prophetic Foundation</strong></p>
</li>
<li>Isaiah’s prophecies foretold that the Spirit would rest on the Messiah, granting wisdom, understanding, counsel, power, knowledge, and reverent awe (Isaiah 11:1–3; 42:1; 61:1).</li>
<li>
<p>These passages show Christ needed the Spirit’s anointing to fulfill His mission.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>New Testament Confirmation</strong></p>
</li>
<li>John 3:34 emphasizes Christ’s speech and works came from the unlimited Spirit given to Him.</li>
<li>
<p>Christ’s frequent prayer and solitude reflect His dependence on divine power.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Christ’s Baptisms of the Spirit</strong></p>
</li>
<li>At His baptism by John, Jesus prayed and received the Holy Spirit as a dove (Luke 3:21).</li>
<li>After overcoming temptation, He returned “in the power of the Spirit” and began teaching boldly (Luke 4:14–15).</li>
<li>
<p>In Nazareth He read Isaiah 61, declared its fulfillment, and amazed the crowd by the Spirit’s power in His words.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Christ as Exemplar for Believers</strong></p>
</li>
<li>If even the sinless Son needed Spirit-baptism, we must likewise seek it before doing God’s work.</li>
<li>
<p>Christ asked the Father for the Spirit, showing us to ask, seek, and wait for “power from on high.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Christ’s Teaching on the Spirit</strong></p>
</li>
<li><strong>Seek and Receive</strong>: "Ask, seek, knock"—God gives the Holy Spirit to those who earnestly ask (Luke 11:9–13).</li>
<li><strong>Personal Presence</strong>: The Spirit is not mere influence but a permanent, personal Comforter abiding within believers (John 14:16–17).</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Greater Blessings</strong>: Believers receive richer gifts and understanding through the Spirit than through Christ’s earthly ministry (John 7:38–39).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Spirit’s Mission</strong></p>
</li>
<li>The Spirit teaches, reminds, guides into truth, glorifies Christ, testifies of Jesus, reproves the world, and reveals future things (John 14–16).</li>
<li>
<p>Through the Spirit we know God and Christ intimately, are transformed into Christ’s likeness, and bear spiritual fruit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Promises Through the Spirit</strong></p>
</li>
<li><strong>Answered Prayer</strong>: In Jesus’ name we may ask anything and receive it so joy may be full (John 16:23–24).</li>
<li><strong>Divine Indwelling</strong>: Father, Son, and Spirit dwell in us, uniting us with God (John 14:23; 17:21–23).</li>
<li><strong>Peace and Joy</strong>: We share Christ’s peace and joy as the Spirit abides in us (John 14:27; 17:13).</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Greater Works</strong>: Believers, empowered by the Spirit, will do even greater works than Jesus did (John 14:12).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Church’s Mission and Unity</strong></p>
</li>
<li>All believers, as a Spirit-anointed body, are sent to labor for world salvation.</li>
<li>
<p>Each receives a special baptism of power for their unique mission, and together exhibits unity, love, and divine power that convinces the world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Christ’s Final Commission</strong></p>
</li>
<li>After rising, Jesus breathed the Spirit on His disciples, commanded them to wait in Jerusalem for Spirit baptism, and then sent them out to preach with power (John 20:22; Acts 1:4–8).</li>
<li>Believers must both go in Christ’s name and tarry until they receive the Spirit’s power.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong>
Jesus, though divine, modeled for us the need to seek and depend on the Holy Spirit. Through prophetic promise and His own teaching and example, He shows that Spirit-baptism is essential for empowering, guiding, and transforming believers to finish God’s work and bear witness to the world.</p>                </article>
