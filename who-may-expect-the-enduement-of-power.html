<p>In John 14:15–17, Jesus promises to send the Holy Spirit—the “Comforter” or Spirit of truth—to abide with believers forever. Christians across history have witnessed this divine power in every form of ministry, from private conversation to public preaching. While some individuals experience it more strongly than others, the gift itself belongs to every Christian called to share the gospel.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Universal Promise to the Church</strong>  </li>
<li>
<p>The command to make disciples of all nations was given to the entire Church, not only the apostles. Accordingly, the promise of a divine enduement of power applies to all who labor in Christ’s name, wherever the duty to win souls exists.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Not Limited by Office, Gender, Age, or Education</strong>  </p>
</li>
<li><strong>Laymen and Clergy:</strong> From Stephen to Father Carpenter (a self-taught lay evangelist whose labors led to thousands of conversions), both ordained ministers and laypeople have received this gift in remarkable measure.  </li>
<li><strong>Women:</strong> The New Testament records female coworkers in the gospel, and history abounds with women whose anointed words stirred revivals. Churches and mission boards are increasingly recognizing their God‑given effectiveness.  </li>
<li><strong>Young and Old:</strong> Some receive this power immediately upon conversion; others grow into it over years. It rests on both new converts and veteran Christians alike.  </li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cultured and Unlearned:</strong> Human eloquence and scholarship cannot substitute for the Spirit’s power. Even the fisherman Peter preached with transformative effect after his baptism of fire at Pentecost.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Conditions and Characteristics of the Enduement</strong>  </p>
</li>
<li><strong>A Gift, Not a Skill:</strong> It is an instantaneous anointing—a gift of the Spirit—rather than the fruit of training or habit. Its depth may grow or wane depending on faithful use.  </li>
<li><strong>Essential for Conversion:</strong> No measure of human persuasion can truly convert without the Spirit impressing God’s truth on the heart.  </li>
<li>
<p><strong>Vulnerability:</strong> The gift can be quenched by spiritual neglect or disobedience, underscoring the need for continual dependence on God.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Implications for the Church</strong>  </p>
</li>
<li><strong>Seminaries and Leadership:</strong> Academic credentials must not eclipse the evidence of Spirit‑empowered ministry. Those who teach future ministers should themselves display and affirm the indispensability of this power.  </li>
<li><strong>Church Offices:</strong> Pastors, elders, deacons, missionaries, and other leaders ought to exhibit and encourage this enduement. A congregation without Spirit‑filled laborers reflects either a pastor who lacks this fire or one who fails to nurture it among members.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The promise of power from on high is coextensive with the call to witness. All Christians—regardless of station, gender, or education—may and should ask for this anointing to win souls for Christ. Without it, all human efforts are ineffectual; with it, even the humblest believer becomes a compelling instrument of God’s saving grace.</p>
