<p>A century ago, many evangelical Christians lived with an urgent conviction that Christ’s return—and a subsequent thousand-year reign—was imminent. This belief shaped their worldview and actions: funds were prioritized for missionary work over church maintenance, and daily life revolved around hastening and preparing for the Great Tribulation and Armageddon.</p>
<p>Yet this fervent hope has faded. Whereas early believers shared a unifying, optimistic vision, today’s Christians wrestle with scattered concerns and self-conscious defenses. Modern theology often debates basics—scripture, creation, prayer—rather than fostering simple, expectant faith. In the affluent West, comfort dulls anticipation: it’s hard to yearn for a distant kingdom when life here feels so secure. A blur of material ease, from instant conveniences to one-click culture, breeds impatience, making us ill-suited to wait on God’s timetable.</p>
<p>Moreover, theological confusion has sapped anticipation. Endless quarrels over prophetic detail have left many uncertain where to place their hope. While belief in Christ’s return remains doctrinally intact, the sense of eager expectation—the joyful, unifying optimism of early Christianity—has largely vanished.</p>
<p>Several factors explain this decline:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Affluence and distraction</strong>: Prosperous Christians lack the hunger and urgency of earlier generations, whose simplicity fueled their longing for the world to come.</li>
<li><strong>Impatience</strong>: The modern obsession with speed and instant gratification clashes with the open-ended silence of prophecy.</li>
<li><strong>Theological overanalysis</strong>: Debates over minutiae of end-times prophecy confuse rather than inspire.</li>
<li><strong>Diminished Christology</strong>: A demoted or rationalized view of Christ undermines confidence in His sovereign return.</li>
</ul>
<p>Recovering that spirit of anticipation may demand more than argument or prophecy charts—it may require a renewal of childlike faith and innocent hope. Absent a profound shift—perhaps even a global crisis to shatter false trusts and refocus hearts on Christ—the radiant optimism that once animated the Church may remain elusive.</p>
