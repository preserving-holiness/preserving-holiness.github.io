<p><strong>Key Texts:</strong>
- 1 Corinthians 1:30; Zechariah 13:1; Titus 3:5</p>
<h4>1. Ancient Fountains as a Spiritual Picture</h4>
<p>In ancient Palestine, cities dug deep rock reservoirs and sealed them to store water against droughts or sieges. When opened, these fountains gave life—cool drinking water and a means to cleanse. If the reservoir cracked and ran dry, it was called a “broken cistern” and was a source of despair.</p>
<p>In Scripture, God and Christ are often compared to these fountains:
- <strong>Fountain sealed:</strong> A special source of joy guarded for someone beloved.
- <strong>Fountain opened:</strong> A time of deliverance when water (life) flows freely.
- <strong>Broken cistern:</strong> False hopes that disappoint.
- <strong>Fountain of living water:</strong> God’s continual supply of spiritual life.</p>
<h4>2. Salvation in Christ: Objective and Subjective</h4>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Christ’s redemption is perfect and complete, offering everything our souls need. It stands ready whether people accept it or not.</p>
<p><strong>Subjective:</strong> It becomes real when the soul desperately seeks freedom from sin, recognizes Christ’s sacrifice, and trusts in His cleansing power—like city-dwellers urgently praying to open their sealed reservoir.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Closed fountain (to the unbelieving soul):</strong> Christ’s grace is ignored when hearts cling to worldly pleasures, pride, or self-righteousness.</li>
<li><strong>Opened fountain (to the believer):</strong> When the Holy Spirit opens hearts, Christ becomes “the power and wisdom of God” for redemption, offering peace and strength.</li>
</ul>
<h4>3. A Higher Blessing: Baptism of the Holy Spirit</h4>
<p>Beyond initial salvation, believers can experience a deeper blessing when filled with the Holy Spirit (the Pentecost event). Before this:
- Faith is cautious and dim.
- Assurance is weak; obedience is by effort.
- Joy and peace come in small measures.</p>
<p>After the Spirit’s outpouring:
- Truth shines clearly; doubts vanish.
- Strength flows naturally; obedience becomes joyful.
- Inner thirst for God is fully quenched--"living water springs up into everlasting life."</p>
<h4>4. Prophetic Promise: "In That Day"</h4>
<p>Zechariah’s prophecy speaks of a future time when every believer will experience this Spirit-filled life:
- God will purify His people completely—no sin found (Jer. 31:33–34; Ezek. 36:25).
- The Spirit will be poured out on all believers, young and old (Joel 2:28–29).
- The Church will shine so brightly that nations will come to its light (Isa. 60:1–3).
- This marks the beginning of lasting glory and the millennium.</p>
<h4>5. Conditions for the Fountain to Flow</h4>
<p><strong>For Individuals:</strong>
1. Deep hunger and thirst for holiness.
2. Prayerful seeking of divine fullness.
3. Open faith that Christ alone meets every need.
4. A personal encounter where the Spirit reveals Christ’s fullness.</p>
<p>Once one believer is filled, their testimony stirs others to seek the same. Their transformed lives become rivers of life reaching many.</p>
<p><strong>For Churches:</strong>
1. Hold and preach the truth of full redemption.
2. Live out its cleansing power in members’ lives.
3. Manifest the Spirit’s transforming work visibly.</p>
<p>A church meeting these conditions shines as a beacon; around it, people find Christ and cleansing as from an opened fountain.</p>
<h4>6. The Role of Methodism</h4>
<p>Methodism’s creed centers on full and free redemption in Christ. Its glory lies in:
- Upholding this gospel truth.
- Demonstrating its life-changing power in believers.</p>
<p>If Methodism remains true, it will lead many into the Spirit’s fullness. If it falls into dead orthodoxy, it will lose its mission and shame itself.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>This abridgment preserves the core imagery and teaching: Christ as a sealed fountain opened to cleanse and empower believers, culminating in a universal outpouring of the Spirit that fulfills prophecy and marks the Church’s greatest glory.</em></p>                </article>
