<p><strong>How to Receive</strong><br>
1. <strong>Consecration.</strong> The early disciples devoted themselves wholly to Christ’s mission.<br>
2. <strong>Prayer and Waiting.</strong> They prayed together and waited in Jerusalem until Pentecost, when the Holy Spirit fell (Luke 11:13).  </p>
<p>These steps remain both the promise and the pattern for all ages: surrender everything, pray persistently, and trust God to pour out His Spirit.  </p>
<p><strong>Barriers to Power</strong><br>
Though everyone prays for this gift, many remain powerless. Finney identifies key hindrances—sins and attitudes that keep the Spirit from coming in fullness:**  </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unwillingness or Half‑heartedness.</strong> Not truly wanting God’s will enough to give up comfort or control.  </li>
<li><strong>Unconfessed Sin.</strong> Self‑indulgence, dishonesty, resentment, and unforgiveness block God’s ear.  </li>
<li><strong>Self‑Reliance.</strong> Depending on intellect, training, or denominational ties rather than the Spirit’s work.  </li>
<li><strong>Resistance to the Spirit.</strong> Ignoring conviction, quenching zeal, grumbling, and allowing evil tempers.  </li>
<li><strong>Neglect and Imbalance.</strong> Over‑busyness, lack of prayer, careless study, and impatience.  </li>
<li><strong>Worldliness and Selfish Ambition.</strong> Pursuing personal gain, status, or denominational advantage.  </li>
<li><strong>Unbelief.</strong> The worst of all—doubting God’s promise makes Him out to be a liar.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Until these are dealt with, asking in prayer cannot secure the promised power.  </p>
<p><strong>Peace vs. Power</strong><br>
Many Christians enjoy forgiveness (the Spirit’s peace) but stop short of seeking anointing for service (the Spirit’s power). True empowerment comes only when believers go beyond conversion to full dependence on the Holy Spirit.  </p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br>
If we lay everything on God’s altar—time, talents, tithes—and test His promise, He will open the windows of heaven and pour out a blessing until there is no more room to receive it.</p>                </article>
